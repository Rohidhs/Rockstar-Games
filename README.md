In today’s visually driven digital world, the ability to design and develop responsive, interactive web interfaces is a vital skill for any aspiring web developer. As part of our Campus Recruitment Training, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting and creative mini project — developing a Rockstar Games Clone Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project wasn’t just about replicating a website layout. It was a hands-on journey through front-end design, UI/UX development, and client-side scripting. It helped us connect theoretical knowledge with practical implementation in real time — an experience that truly bridged the classroom with industry-like workflows.

Project Overview
We designed and developed a visually rich, interactive clone of the Rockstar Games official website. The goal was to recreate its structural components and visual storytelling while enhancing it with our own creative touches and clean code architecture.

Key capabilities of the clone include:

Responsive banner carousel with game covers

Interactive hover animations and transitions

Organized grid-based sections (Featured Games, Newswire, Support, and more)

Seamless navigation UI replicating the feel of the original site

Modular code using separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Key Learnings
This project helped us strengthen our practical front-end development skills:

Mastering HTML5 for semantic layout design

Implementing CSS3 for animations, effects, and responsiveness

Using Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and slider functionality

Applying layout tools like Flexbox and Grid to structure web pages

Designing scalable, readable, and maintainable front-end codebases

Key Functionalities
The website clone is structured into multiple key components:

Hero Section: Image slider with clickable indicators

Games Section: Featured cards with “View Product” options on hover

Newswire Section: Latest updates displayed using dynamic layout

Support UI Clone: Functional design of Rockstar Support interface

Subscription Section: Custom input design with hover effects

Each section was designed with attention to detail and responsiveness, ensuring the site works across screen sizes and devices.
